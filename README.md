# QOI

This repository contains an implementation of the QOI format ("Quite OK Image Format"). The format's specification, reference implementation and more can be found [here](https://qoiformat.org/).

The primary goal of this project is to be educational for myself. The project will be considered complete, when the encoder and decoder for QOI images works as specified by the format's specification.

The Encoder and Decoder should be finished, but have not yet been fully tested. Tests and PNG <=> QOI converters will come soon.
