# QOI

This repository contains an implementation of the QOI format ("Quite OK Image Format"). The format's specification, reference implementation and more can be found [here](https://qoiformat.org/).

The primary goal of this project is to be educational for myself.

The Encoder and Decoder are finished and have been tested. A PNG <=> QOI converter may come someday too.

The `ref_qoi` folder contains the [reference encoder/decoder](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi) by [phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab/), which were used to create a test for my encoder & decoder implementation.

The images in the `imgs` folder were taken from the [qoiview](https://github.com/floooh/qoiview) repo.
